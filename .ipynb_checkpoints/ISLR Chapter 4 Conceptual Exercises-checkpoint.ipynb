    "1. In the case of $p = 1$ feature, $X$, which is uniformly distributed on $[0, 1]$, if we wish to predict a test observation's response using only observations that are within 10% of the range of $X$ closest to that test observation, the interval containing the observations used for prediction will be $[X - 0.05, X + 0.05]$ if $0.5 \\leq X \\leq 0.95$, which has a length of $0.10$. If $0 \\leq X < 0.05$, then the interval used for prediction will be $[0, X + 0.05]$, which has a length of $X + 0.05$. Similarly, if $0.95 < X \\leq 1$ the the interval used for prediction will be $[X - 0.05, 1]$, which has a length of $1.05 - X$. Let $L(x)$ be the length of the interval used for prediction associated with a test observation $X = x$. Then, since $X$ is assumed to be uniformly distributed on $[0, 1]$, the average length of the interval used for prediction is the average of $L(x)$ on $[0, 1]$. From calculus, the average value of an integrable function $f(x)$ on the interval $[a, b]$ is given by\n",

    "    \\frac{1}{b - a} \\int_a^b f(x) \\, dx\n",

    "    = .0975.\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "In other words, on average 9.75% of the available observations will be considered when making the prediction. Note that this aligns with the intuition that about 10% of the available observations, on average, will be considered when making the prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Assuming $X_1$ and $X_2$ are independent and $(X_1, X_2)$ is uniformly distributed on $[0, 1] \\times [0, 1]$, we know from Part 1 for a fixed value of $X_1$ on average 9.75% of the observations when varying $X_2$ will be available for making a prediction. Likewise, the same is true for a fixed value of $X_2$ and varying $X_1$. This tells us that on average the fraction of the available observations which will be considered when making the prediction for a given test observation is $0.0975^2 = 0.00950625 \\approx 0.01$. We can also verify this, as well as do Part 3 below, using the multivariable calculus extension for the formula to compute the average value of an integrable function $f(x_1, \\dots, x_p)$ on the region $R = [a_1, b_1] \\times \\dots \\times [a_p, b_p]$\n",

    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "to compute the average area of the region considered when making a prediction given predictors $X_p = x_p$.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. As we found in Parts 1 and 2, the fraction of the available observations which will be considered when making the prediction for a given test observation with predictor values $X_p = x_p$ is $0.0975^p \\approx 0.1^p$. For $p = 100$, this is $7.95 \\times 10^{-102}$, or essentially zero. In other words, essentially none of the available observations will be considered when making the prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. As we saw in Parts 1 through 3, the fraction of observations for which $X_p$ is within 10% of the range of the test observation's value for the predictor $X_p = x_p$, for all $p$ is about $10^{-p}$, which is essentially zero for large values of $p$. More generally, the [volume of a $p$-dimensional ball of fixed radius $R$](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume_of_an_n-ball) tends to zero as $p$ approaches infinity. This means that for any conventionally intuitive and desirable notion of \"near\" (e.g. all predictor values within a particular percent of the range of the test observation; staying within a fixed (Euclidean) distance of the test observation) there are very few training observations \"near\" any given test observation. Therefore, when performing KNN using data with a large number of predictors, the $k$-\"nearest\" neigbors for a given test observation are highly likely to actually be quite far from that test observation, in the sense that they are not \"near\" using one of those notions of near mentioned above. As a result, KNN with large values of $p$ attempts to make a prediction for the test observation using neighbors which are quite unlikely to be \"near\" enough to the test observation for the prediction to be meaningfully accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Creating a $p$-dimensional hypercube centered around the test observation that contains, on average, 10% of the training observations is, in the context of this exercise, equivalent to requiring that our hypercube have a volume of 0.1. Since the volume (or more technically $p$-volume of a $p$-dimensional hypercube with side length $s$ is given by $V = s^p$, a $p$-dimensional hypercube with a volume $V$ has a side length of $s = V^{1/p}$. Thus for $p = 1$, $s = 0.1$; for $p = 2$, $s = 0.1^{1/2} \\approx 0.3162$; and when $p = 100$, $s = 0.1^{1/100} \\approx 0.9772$. This means that for large values of $p$, the vast majority of the volume of a $p$-dimensional hypercube is located very close to its boundary. This further emphasizes the point from Part 4 that when performing KNN using data with a large number of predictors, even the $k$-\"nearest\" neighbors for a given test observation will be highly likely to have predictor values vastly different from the predictor values for the test observation."

    "1. When the Bayes decision boundary is linear, we expect QDA to have lower training error as a result of its increased flexibility over LDA. However, we would expect LDA to have lower test error since it produces a linear decision boundary, is also the shape of the Bayes decision boundary in this case. The higher variance introduced by the flexibility of QDA wouldn't be offset by the lower bias, so QDA is an overly flexible model for this situation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. When the Bayes decision boundary is non-linear, we expect QDA to have both lower training error (for the same reason noted above in Part 1) and lower test error. In this situation, the linear nature of LDA results means that it won't be able to accurately approximate the non-linear Bayes decision boundary, resulting in higher training error than QDA.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. As the sample size $n$ increases, the we generally expect the test prediction of QDA relative to LDA to improve. This is because as the size of the training set increases, reducing model variance becomes less crucial, since no change in a single data point is likely to greatly affect the model compared to when there are a small number of training observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. False. If we have few training observations, the increased flexibility of QDA over LDA will likely lead to QDA overfitting to the random noise in the training set. This would then result in a worse test error rate when using QDA compared to the test error rate for LDA. In other words, when there are few training observations, reducing model variance is crucial, so the increased variance in QDA over LDA will not be offset by the reduction in bias, resulting in worse test performance from QDA."

    "Suppose that we wish to predict whether a given stock will issue a dividend this year (\"Yes\" or \"No\") based on $X$, last year's percent profit. We examine a large number of companies and discover that the mean value of $X$ for companies that issued a dividend was $\\bar{X} = 10$, while the mean for those that didn't was $\\bar{X} = 0$. In addition, the variance of $X$ for these two sets of companies was $\\hat{\\sigma}^2 = 36$. Finally, 80% of companies issued dividends. Assuming that $X$ follows a normal distribution, predict the probability that a company will issue a dividend this year given that its percentage profit was $X = 4$ last year.\n",

In addition, we have prior probabilities $\\pi_1 = 0.8$ and $\\pi_2 = 0.2$, since 80% of companies issued dividends.

    "Suppose we take a data set, divide it into equally-sized training and test sets, and then try out two different classification procedures. First we use logistic regression and get an error rate of 20% on the training data and 30% on the test data. Next we use 1-nearest neighbors (i.e. KNN with $K = 1$) and get an average error rate (averaged over both test and training data sets) of 18%. Based on these results, which method should we prefer to use for classification of new observations? Why?"

    "\n",
    "When performing KNN with $K = 1$, the training error is always going to be zero. This is because the KNN classifier assigns each point $x_0$ to the class for which the proportion of the $K$ points in the training set closest to $x_0$ is the greatest. If $x_0$ is already in training set, then its closest neighbor is itself, so it will always be assigned to its actual class. Thus, the average error rate of 18% for KNN with $K = 1$ actually translates to a test error rate of 36%. Since this is larger than the 30% test error rate from logistic regression, we should choose logistic regression over KNN with $K = 1$ to more accurately classify new observations."
