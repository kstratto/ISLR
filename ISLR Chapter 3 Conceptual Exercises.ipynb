    "Generally speaking, the p-values given in the table report the partial effect of adding that variable to the model. In other words, they provide information about whether each individual predictor is related to the response, after adjusting for the other predictors. The p-value for `TV` corresponds to a null hypothesis that the coefficient for `TV` is zero, or in other words that TV advertising has no relationship with sales, in the presence of radio and newspaper advertising. Since the p-value for `TV` is essentially zero, there is strong evidence that TV advertising is related to sales. Things are similar for `radio`. Its p-value corresponds to a null hypothesis that the coefficient for `radio` is zero, or in other words that radio advertising has no relationship with sales, in the presence of TV and newspaper advertising. Once again, since the p-value is essentially zero, there is strong evidence that radio advertising is related to sales. Lastly, the p-value for `newspaper` corresponds to a null hypothesis that the coefficient for `newspaper` is zero, or in other words that newspaper advertising has no relationship with sales, in the presence of TV and radio advertising. Here, since the p-value for `newspaper` is quite large at 0.8599, there is no evidence that newspaper advertising is related to sales, in the presence of TV and radio advertising."

    "The KNN classifier and KNN regression methods are similar in the fact that both use information from the $K$ neighbors which are closest to the prediction point $x_0$ in order to make a prediction. Where they differ is in types of responses that each is used for, with KNN classification being used with categorical response variables to assign the prediction point to a class, and KNN regression being used with quantitative response variables to estimate the numerical value of the response. This is illustrated in the formulas underlying each method. In KNN regression, $f(x_0)$ is estimated by taking the average of all the training responses in $\\mathcal{N}_0$, the set of the $K$ training observations which are nearest to $x_0$.\n",

For GPA values above 3.5, the coefficient of $X_3$ becomes negative, meaning that for a fixed value of IQ and a fixed GPA value greater than 3.5, males earn more on average.

    "1. I would expect the training RSS for the cubic regression to be lower than that of the linear regression, since cubic regression has a higher level of flexibility. As the flexibility of a model increases, the training mean squared error, which is equal to the product of the training RSS and the number of observations $n$, decreases monotonically. This is regardless of the nature of the true relationship between $X$ and $Y$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. I would expect the test RSS for the linear regression to be lower than that of the cubic regression. Test RSS depends on the variance and squared bias of the model, as well as by the variance of $\\epsilon$. Since the true relationship in this situation is linear, linear regression has lower bias than cubic regression. Moreover, linear regression, as a less-flexible model, always has less variance than cubic regression, since variance is a measure of how much the model would change if we estimated it using a different training set. Thus, since the variance of $\\epsilon$ is a constant and the linear model has lower bias and variance compared to the cubic model, linear regression will result in a lower test RSS compared to cubic regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Similar to part (1), I would expect the training RSS for the cubic regression to be lower than that of the linear regression. Again this is due to the fact that cubic regression has a higher level of flexibility, and increased flexibility results in lower training mean squared error, and hence lower training RSS.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. In this situation, cubic regression will likely have less bias than linear regression, since the true relationship is not linear. However, since we don't know how far it is from linear, we don't know the size of the difference in bias between the two models. Moreover, as noted in part (2), cubic regression has higher variance than linear regression, so the accuracy of a cubic regression model depends more on the training data. Since we don't know anything about the training data, we don't know how well it actually represents the relationshp between the predictor and the response. Because we don't know the size of the difference in bias between the two models, and also since cubic regression has higher variance and we don't know anything further about the training data, we don't have enough information to compare the values of the test RSS between the two models in this situation."
